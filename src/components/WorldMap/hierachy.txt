Here is what I thought about the App components hierachy:

					<Router>
					/      \
			    <entrance page>  <country profile>
			    /      /
                   <Head bar>    <World map>
                    /
               <Menubutton>
                  /
               <Sidebar>
		/
           <Country Container>
	       /    /    ......
        <Country1>  <Country2>......


The entrance page is implemented in sample2.js, country profile is only some texts in sample_profile.js

To communicate between each component, say the sidebar country flag clicked, and the world map rotate, 
we have to set the real function implement in entrance page, and pass this function as props of each components
all the way down to the Country1 component. I can only figure out this way to pass parameter between components.
If you guys can think a more efficient way, please share with me.

And the hierachy looks a little bit tedious, I am open to any suggestions of modification.
